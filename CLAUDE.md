When you haven't read it yet, read README.md to have relevant context.

Development cycle when developing a feature:
- Verify the task with me before starting executing it
- Execute it
- Run the resulting code in a simulator
- Make screenshot of the changes, append it to existing screenshots in screenshots directory
- Commit the code

Development cycle when fixing a bug:
- Verify the bug with me before starting executing it
- Reproduce the bug
- Fix it
- Verify that the bug is fixed
- Run the resulting code in a simulator
- Make screenshot of the changes, append it to existing screenshots in the screeshots directory
- Commit the code

Best practicies:
- Keep app components decoupled
- Keep API of components stable when possible
- Don't mention yourself in commits
